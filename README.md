# round2
I’m working with data models generated from JSON Schemas using datamodel-code-generator, and I want to build a generic, safe, and reusable system for populating these models in multiple steps.
# Goals:
Accept a generated Pydantic model (from the JSON Schema).
Allow partial filling of the model in multiple steps.
Ensure strict validation of each field as per the schema.
# Track and report:
Which fields have been filled.
Which required/optional fields are still missing.
If any unknown or unexpected keys are present in the input.
Output a fully valid JSON representation of the final filled model.
Avoid writing custom fill functions for each new data model — the system should work with any schema-generated model dynamically.
Strong emphasis on data integrity and validation safety throughout the process.
#  Why:
The current approach requires writing boilerplate code to fill and validate each new model manually. I want to eliminate this redundancy and ensure that all generated data is consistent, schema-compliant, and traceable at every step.
